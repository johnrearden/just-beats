## Libraries and Programs Used
1. [Lucid](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)
    - Lucid charts were used to create the execution path diagrams.
2. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
    - Heroku was used to deploy the project
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Version control was implemented using Git through the Github terminal.
4. [Github](https://github.com/)
    - Github was used to store the projects after being pushed from Git and its cloud service [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) was used to serve the project on the web.
5. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - VS Code was used locally as the main IDE environment, primarily because it was easier to set up a development environment locally than in GitPod (I wasn't sure how to persist the Jest installation across different GitPod sessions)
6. [PyCharm-Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
    - I switched to PyCharm towards the end of the project, as it has better support for PEP8 compliance.
7. [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)
    - Pytest was used for automated testing.
